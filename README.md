# nodejs-web-mashup
This is a mashup of the Swellcast, Forecast.io and Google Maps API's.
It passes data through each API, parsing JSON objects and processing new information each time. 
The result is a map with up to date markers showing beach forecasts using a combination of weather and swell data.
